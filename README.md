How the game is played :

so my game starts when we enter on "let's play" at the first which activates the game
and we keep play and flip the cards until they all match then it gives me the total 
time it took to win the rating and the total moves it took you to win and then gives
you the option to restart again

What the player is to expect from the game :

the player will have a functional user friendly game that is easy to use and will bring
so much pleasre and fun to spend time playing it
